# Eleculator
Eleculator is a command line calculator for electronic formulas, it can calculate ohms law amongst other things.

At some point Eleculator will be able to simulate circuits, currents, voltage and possibly have a GUI.

### Running

I'll build binaries at some point, for now, download `The Haskell tool stack` simply known as `stack` and execute:

```shell
$ stack build && stack exec eleculator 
```
